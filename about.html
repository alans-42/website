                I was born and raised in Hudson Valley, New York, and am currently finishing up my bachelor's in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo.<br>
                It was not until my last couple of years in high school that I realized Computer Science was everything that I was looking for in a career.<br>
                It dealt with different challenges and rewarded you when solving them. Also, having the capability to make projects like this website is pretty cool.<br>
                Besides that stuff, I have other interests that have made me who I am.<br>
                Video games have been one of my favorite pastimes with me playing many over the years. I've loved games ranging from way back like Galaga and Tetris to current-day games like Red Dead and Cyberpunk.<br>
                Nowadays, sports have become a big part of my life whether it's been taking part in them or just watching them (Let's go <a class="mk">Mets</a> and <a class="mk">Knicks</a>!).<br>
                Running has been the major sport I've taken part in and while I may not be as consitent as I used to be, I still put time aside to go out for a few runs.<br>
                Besides health, the sport helped me grow in leadership and communication skills that have carried a long way since then. I really do owe a lot to the years I dedicated to it.<br>
                Well that was a quick run down of me, hopefully it gave you a good idea of me!
